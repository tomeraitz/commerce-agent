AI Agent Commerce Assignment
Goal
Build a minimal AI shopping copilot that helps a user discover relevant products through a conversational interface.

The system should understand user intent, retrieve relevant products from the provided API, and present those results clearly inside the chat.

API
Use the DummyJSON Products API as the product catalog.

Base URL: https://dummyjson.com/products

An OpenAPI specification file is provided: dummyjson_products_openapi.yaml (attached to this email).

Use it to understand the available endpoints, filters, and query parameters. You do not need to use every endpoint. Choose the ones that make sense for your solution.

What to Build
Build a locally runnable application with the following:

Conversational experience

The user should be able to interact with the system through chat.

Product discovery

The system should identify what the user is looking for and retrieve relevant products from the API.

In-chat product rendering

Product results should be rendered as a UI widget inside the chat, not just as plain text. Each result should display useful product information such as title, short description, price, and image.

Model Access
You will receive an API key for OpenAI. Choose the model or models you want to use.

Your API Key
OpenAI	***
These keys are provisioned specifically for this assignment and have usage limits. Please do not share them or commit them to your repository. Use environment variables (e.g. a .env file in your .gitignore).

Allowed Models
gpt-5.4-mini, gpt-5.4-nano

Technical Freedom
You may use any language, framework, or architecture you prefer.

If useful, you may explore frameworks such as Mastra, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, assistant-ui, CopilotKit, or LibreChat. You may also build everything from scratch.

We are intentionally not prescribing the implementation approach. Use your judgment.

Deliverables
Submit:

Source code for the application
A README with:
Setup and run instructions
A short explanation of your technical choices
Any assumptions, tradeoffs, or limitations
Deadline
Please submit your solution by Sunday, 19 Apr 2026, 23:59. The API keys will be deactivated after this date.

Notes
The application only needs to run locally.
The main objective is to build a coherent product discovery experience inside chat.
We are interested in how you think about the problem and the choices you make, not only in the final UI.
Submission
To submit, reply to this email with a link to your Git repository.

If anything is unclear, feel free to reply — we're happy to help.

Good luck!
